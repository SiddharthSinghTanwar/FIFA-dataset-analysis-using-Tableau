# FIFA-dataset-analysis-using-Tableau
I used Tableau Public to do some data analysis on the FIFA dataset

The visualization link: [Viz](https://public.tableau.com/views/Tableauassessment1_17339003558170/Top10clubsbyplayervalue?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
The following analysis has been performed:
1. Top 10 clubs by player value.
2. Top 10 players by market value.
3. Top 10 players by growth potential.
4. Top 5 goalkeepers.
5. Top 10 players from each position.
